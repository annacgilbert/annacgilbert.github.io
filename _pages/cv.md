Biography
=====
I received an S.B. degree from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. from Princeton University, both in Mathematics. In 1997, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University and AT&T Labs-Research. From 1998 to 2004, I was a member of technical staff at AT&T Labs-Research in Florham Park, NJ. From 2004 to 2020, I was with the Department of Mathematics (with a secondary appointment in Electrical and Computer Engineering) at the University of Michigan, where I was eventually the Herman H. Goldstine Collegiate Professor. In 2020, I moved to Yale University as the John C. Malone Professor of Mathematics and Professor of Statistics & Data Science. In 2023, I left the Mathematics Department and moved to the Department of Electrical Engineering (keeping my Statistics & Data Science appointment). I have received several awards, including a Sloan Research Fellowship (2006), an NSF CAREER award (2006), the National Academy of Sciences Award for Initiatives in Research (2008), the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Douglas Engelbart Best Paper award (2008), the EURASIP Signal Processing Best Paper award (2010), and the SIAM Ralph E. Kleinman Prize (2013).

My research interests include analysis, probability, discrete mathematics, and algorithms. I am especially interested in randomized algorithms with applications to harmonic analysis, signal and image processing, and massive datasets.
