This project demonstrates smart data collection and processing on the Arduino Mega. It is a port of the simple AAFFT Matlab implementation to the Arduino Mega. Along with this implementation is software to gather acoustic data on the Arduino. We used a sine-wave generator to produce a pure tone which we then sampled at the appropriate times (determined by the Fourier sampling algorithm). The samples were collected from a microphone sensor installed on the Arduino.

Justin Shetty and James Wich were first year undergraduate students at the University of Michigan in the University Research Opportunity Program (UROP) during the academic year 2016-2017.
